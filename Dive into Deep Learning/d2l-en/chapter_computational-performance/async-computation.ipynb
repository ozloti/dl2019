    "## Asynchronous Programming in MXNet\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly speaking, MXNet includes the front-end directly used by users for interaction, as well as the back-end used by the system to perform the computation. For example, users can write MXNet programs in various front-end languages, such as Python, R, Scala and C++. Regardless of the front-end programming language used, the execution of MXNet programs occurs primarily in the back-end of C++ implementations. In other words, front-end MXNet programs written by users are passed on to the back-end to be computed. The back-end possesses its own threads that continuously collect and execute queued tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through the interaction between front-end and back-end threads, MXNet is able to implement asynchronous programming. Asynchronous programming means that the front-end threads continue to execute subsequent instructions without having to wait for the back-end threads to return the results from the current instruction. For simplicity’s sake, assume that the Python front-end thread calls the following four instructions."

When the last statement’s results need to be printed, the Python front-end thread will wait for the C++ back-end thread to finish computing result of the variable `c`. One benefit of such as design is that the Python front-end thread in this example does not need to perform actual computations. Thus, there is little impact on the program’s overall performance, regardless of Python’s performance. MXNet will deliver consistently high performance, regardless of the front-end language’s performance, provided the C++ back-end can meet the efficiency requirements.\n",

    "We have observed that certain aspects of computing performance can be improved by making use of asynchronous programming. To explain this, we will slightly simplify the interaction between the Python front-end thread and the C++ back-end thread. In each loop, the interaction between front and back-ends can be largely divided into three stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The front-end orders the back-end to insert the calculation task `y = x + 1` into the queue.\n",
    "1. The back-end then receives the computation tasks from the queue and performs the actual computations.\n",
    "1. The back-end then returns the computation results to the front-end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that the durations of these three stages are $t_1, t_2, t_3$, respectively. If we do not use asynchronous programming, the total time taken to perform 1000 computations is approximately $1000 (t_1+ t_2 + t_3)$. If asynchronous programming is used, the total time taken to perform 1000 computations can be reduced to $t_1 + 1000 t_2 + t_3$ (assuming $1000t_2 > 999t_1$), since the front-end does not have to wait for the back-end to return computation results for each loop.\n",

    "## The Impact of Asynchronous Programming on Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to explain the impact of asynchronous programming on memory usage, recall what we learned in the previous chapters. Throughout the model training process implemented in the previous chapters, we usually evaluated things like the loss or accuracy of the model in each mini-batch. Detail-oriented readers may have discovered that such evaluations often make use of synchronization functions, such as `item` or `asnumpy`. If these synchronization functions are removed, the front-end will pass a large number of mini-batch computing tasks to the back-end in a very short time, which might cause a spike in memory usage. When the mini-batches makes use of synchronization functions, on each iteration, the front-end will only pass one mini-batch task to the back-end to be computed, which will typically reduce memory use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the deep learning model is usually large and memory resources are usually limited, we recommend the use of synchronization functions for each mini-batch throughout model training, for example by using the `item` or `asnumpy` functions to evaluate model performance. Similarly, we also recommend utilizing synchronization functions for each mini-batch prediction (such as directly printing out the current batch’s prediction results), in order to reduce memory usage during model prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will demonstrate asynchronous programming’s impact on memory. We will first define a data retrieval function `data_iter`, which upon being called, will start timing and regularly print out the time taken to retrieve data batches."
