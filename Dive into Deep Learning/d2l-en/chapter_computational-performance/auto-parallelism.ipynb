    "Typically, a single operator will use all the computational resources on all CPUs or a single GPU. For example, the `dot` operator will use all threads on all CPUs (even if there are multiple CPU processors on a single machine) or a single GPU. If computational load of each operator is large enough and multiple operators are run in parallel on only on the CPU or a single GPU, then the operations of each operator can only receive a portion of computational resources of CPU or single GPU. Even if these computations can be parallelized, the ultimate increase in computing performance may not be significant. In this section, our discussion of automatic parallel computation mainly focuses on parallel computation using both CPUs and GPUs, as well as the parallelization of computation and communication.\n",

    "As we can see, the total time required to perform computation and communication is less than the sum of their separate execution times. It should be noted that this computation and communication task is different from the parallel computation task that simultaneously used the CPU and GPU described earlier in this section. Here, there is a dependency between execution and communication: `y[i]` must be computed before it can be copied to the CPU. Fortunately, the system can copy `y[i-1]` when computing `y[i]` to reduce the total running time of computation and communication.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* MXNet can improve computing performance through automatic parallel computation, such as parallel computation using the CPU and GPU and the parallelization of computation and communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "* 10 operations were performed in the `run` function defined in this section. There are no dependencies between them. Design an experiment to see if MXNet will automatically execute them in parallel.\n",
    "* Designing computation tasks that include more complex data dependencies, and run experiments to see if MXNet can obtain the correct results and improve computing performance.\n",
    "* When the computational load of an operator is small enough, parallel computation on only the CPU or a single GPU may also improve the computing performance. Design an experiment to verify this.\n",
